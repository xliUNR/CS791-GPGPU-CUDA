# Example GPU Programs
## This is for use at the University of Nevada, Reno CS 791v GPU Class
This is part of the first assignment in the class and necessary for turning in assignments throughout the semester.

# Projects

## PA0: Add Two Arrays
This is a simple program to add two arrays by using GPU. To run this project ```cd PA0``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA1: Spinning Cube
This should be an improved version of PA0. You need to follow the ideas from PA0 and what is learned from this course to finish this assignment.

## PA2: Matrix Math
Implementation of GPU matrix multiplication.

## PA3: KNN
K- nearest neighbors data imputation. Uses KNN to impute missing data.

## PA4: MultiGPU matrix multiplication
Same as PA2, but expanded to use multiple GPUs
