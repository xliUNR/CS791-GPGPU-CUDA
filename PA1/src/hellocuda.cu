  This program demonstrates the basics of working with cuda. We use
  the GPU to add two arrays. We also introduce cuda's approach to
  error handling and timing using cuda Events.

  This is the main program. You should also look at the header add.h
  for the important declarations, and then look at add.cu to see how
  to define functions that execute on the GPU.

    directly returning a pointer to the allocated memory, cudaMalloc
    returns the pointer through its first argument, which must be a
    void**. The second argument is the number of bytes we want to
    allocate.

    NB: the return value of cudaMalloc (like most cuda functions) is
    an error code. Strictly speaking, we should check this value and
    perform error handling if anything went wrong. We do this for the
    first call to cudaMalloc so you can see what it looks like, but
    for all other function calls we just point out that you should do
    error checking.

    Actually, a good idea would be to wrap this error checking in a
    function or macro, which is what the Cuda By Example book does.

    process we want to time. When we want to start timing, we call

    pointer to memory allocated on the device. The second argument is
    the source of the copy. The third argument is the number of bytes
    we want to copy. The last argument is a constant that tells

    haven't looked at add.cu (in this folder), you should. The

    let's focus on how add is being called. The first thing to notice
    is the <<<...>>>, which you should recognize as _not_ being
    standard C. This syntactic extension tells nvidia's cuda compiler
    how to parallelize the execution of the function. We'll get into
    details as the course progresses, but for we'll say that <<<N,
    1>>> is creating N _blocks_ of 1 _thread_ each. Each of these
    threads is executing add with a different data element (details of
    the indexing are in add.cu). 

    In larger programs, you will typically have many more blocks, and
    each block will have many threads. Each thread will handle a
    different piece of data, and many threads can execute at the same
    time. This is how cuda can get such large speedups.

    just like the cudaMemcpy calls above, except that the direction of
    the transfer (given by the last argument) is reversed. In a real
